Description: The package contains various tools facilitating the analysis
    of samples with highly heterogeneous cell types, such as MAGIC
    imputation wrappers, signature scoring, cell type classifier based on
    markers (relying on signature scoring and MAGIC imputation to overcome
    dropouts), quality control (QC) by cell type (relying on the previous
    classifier), cell type aware QC plots, cell type classification based 
    on signatures, interactive clustering and demultiplexing based on mutations,
    interactive exploration of mutations/variants at the single cell level etc.
