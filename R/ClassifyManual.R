#' Manual cell type classification by applying gates
#'
#' This function performs a cell type classification by gating.
#'
#' Based on cell scores (sign_x, which can be signatures from ScoreSignatures, genetic similarities to reference genotypes, normalized hashtag oligo (HTO) values, gene expression, QC parameters etc), cell types (celltype_a, celltype_b...) are defined based on gates (value_xy cutoffs) of the form:
#'
#' "celltype_a = sign_a > value_aa & sign_b < value_ab,
#'  celltype_b = sign_b > value_ba & sign_a < value_ab [...etc...]"
#'
#' Scores are taken from the metadata in priority, otherwise from assays. If found in several assays, the assay to use should be defined by prefixing the feature name with "assay_".
#'
#' Since single cell data tends to be noisy and have a significant amount of dropouts, imputation is usually a great combination with gating strategies, in a similar fashion to gaussian filtering needed before thresholding in most image analysis workflows. For this, see Impute() and CrossImpute().
#'
#' @param object Seurat object. Must have metadata columns containing signature scores, such as those generated by ScoreSignatures, with names matching any gating filter supplied.
#' @param gates charater(1). Gate definitions, with gates for various cell types delimited by commas (,). For each gate, the name of the cell type is given first, followed by equal (=) and a series of gates separated by AND symbol (&). Example: "celltype_a = sign_a > value_aa & sign_b < value_ab, celltype_b = sign_b > value_ba & sign_a < value_ab" where sign_a and sign_b are the names of metadata columns and value_xy are numeric values.
#' @param metadata.name The name of the new metadata column where cell type annotations are stored (Default: celltype)
#' @param assay character(1). If some signatures used for classification are stored as assay features, which assay should be used in priority (Default: DefaultAssay(object)).
#' @param slot character(1). If some signatures used for classification are stored as assay features, which slot should be used (Default: "data").
#' @param restrict.ident character(1). The name of a metadata column containing celltype annotations, which will be used to define the subset of cells that should be classified. Default: current Idents(object). 
#' @param restrict.to character(n). Which celltypes (as defined in the restrict.ident metadata column) should be classified. Default: All cells. 
#' @return A Seurat object with an additional metadata column containing the cell type annotations and Idents() set to these annotations. Cells which do not validate any gate defined are attributed the celltype "None" and cells which pass several gates are labelled "Multiplet".
